Task 1.2: simple strategies for tic tac toe
		1. implement a probabilistic strategy

The first part of the exercise, i.e. "have both players play many games (at least 1000).
After the whole tournament, plot a histogram of wins and draws" and the collection of the count data is in the file
"part1_tournament_1.py"

The second part of the exercise, i.e. "implement a function that realizes a game move using the probabilities you just 
determined" and "start another tournament and plot the new histogram of wins and draws" is in the file 
"part2_tournament_2.py"

Both files can be run from the terminal with the following commands:

python part1_tournament_1.py 
python part2_tournament_2.py
