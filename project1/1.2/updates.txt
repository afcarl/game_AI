Here I will write all updates i made and the difference it made to the code/performance:

1) Added Hashing: Reduced number of nodes in tree from ~19000 to 16167. Takes about .88 seconds to learn tree.
2) Added the trivial() method: This reduced the number of nodes in tree from 16167 to 10869. Take about .63 seconds to learn tree.
3) Used the fact that rotations are similar. This reduced the number of nodes in tree even further. From 10869 to 2736. Now takes about .29 seconds to learn tree.
