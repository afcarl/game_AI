Project 3
=============

**Task:**
Self organizing maps to represent player movements: The files q3dm1-path1.csv and q3dm1-path2.csv contain trajectory data,
i.e. sequences of vectors x_t which indicate a human player’s 3D position at time t on the Quake III map q3dm1.
Fit self organizing maps (SOMs) to both data sets.Choose the SOM topology to be a circular path graph v1 ↔ v2 ↔ ... ↔ vl ↔ v1
of l vertices. Experiment with different choices of l and visualize your results.
The following two videos provide an idea as to how a visualization may look like:
