Task 2.3: Minmax for connect4 with depth restriction

The file can be run from the terminal with the command

python connectfour-withMinmax.py

It will ask for the difficulty (= depth the tree will be built) and then print the new game states after the "clever" player and the random player played. 
Also it will print out how many moves it took for the winning player to win.
