================================

To run the visualization run "python gui.py <some map>" from terminal.

The maps are normal maps so u can use any of them.

There are also made random mazes in the "mazes" directory. So one can load them too.

Now Once it is running:
You will see the grid. Left click to select source cell and right click to select destination cell.
Then click on any of the buttons to run the respective algorithms. IF there is a path it will be displayed.
