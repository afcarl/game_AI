Project 2 
===============

**Task 2.1:**
Compute the complete tic tac toe game tree (starting with an empty board and player X to move and ignoring symmetries). How many nodes does the tree really have? How many of these nodes correspond to a situation where player X wins? What is the average branching factor of the tree?

**Task 2.2:**
Implement the minmax algorithm and use your implementation to compute mmv(n0) for the following tree

**Solution: **
The files can be run from the terminal with the commands

    python tic_tac_toe_tree.py
    python min_max_algorithm.py
